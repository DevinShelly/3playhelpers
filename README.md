Just a couple of files I use to make things easier on 3Play. 

How to use:

1. Install the Custom Javascript extension for Chrome (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-javascript-for-web/poakhlngfciodnhlhhgnaaelnpjljija?hl=en)

2. Open the marketplace, click the cjs icon in the extensions bar, and copy and paste the contents of available_jobs.js and save. That will add a button which allows you to autorefresh the marketplace

3. Open a job. Again click the cjs icon and copy and paste the jobs.js file and save. This adds the ability to use a keyboard shortcut to change speeds by hitting Ctr + [ and Ctr+], and it also allows you to quickly toggle between 1.0 and whatever previous speed you were using, which I've found really helpful when doing files with differing microphone levels (say a lecture where the professor is mic'ed up but the students are not)
